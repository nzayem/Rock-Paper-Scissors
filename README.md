# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Simple game with scoring. 

This is the Stage 5 out of 6 of the JetBrains Academy that have this description:

When the game starts, the user should enter his/her name. After that, the program should greet the user and read a file namedrating.txt . This is a file containing current scores for different players. You can see the file format below: it's just lines containing user's name and his/her score divided by a single space.

Tim 350
Jane 200
Alex 400
If there’s a record for the user with the same name in the file, the program should take his/her rating and use it as a reference point for counting current user’s score (for example, if the user entered name Tim, then his score at the start of the game will be 350). If the user's name isn't written in the file, then your program should count user's score from 0.

You don't need to write anything in the rating.txt file!

The program should print user's score when the user enters !rating. For example, if your rating is 0 then the program should print:

Your rating: 0
Your program should add 50 points to the player for every draw, 100 for every win, and nothing for losing.

Objectives
Your program should:

Output a line Enter your name: . Note that the user should enter his/her name on the same line (not the one following the output!)
Read input specifying the user's name and output a new line Hello, <name>
Read a file named rating.txt and check if there's a record for the user with the same name; if yes, use the score specified in the rating.txt for this user as a starting point for calculating the score in the current game. If no, start counting user's score from 0.
Play the game by the rules defined on the previous stages:
Read user's input
If the input is !exit, output Bye! and stop the game
If the input is the name of the option, then:
Pick a random option
Output a line with the result of the game in the following format (<option> is the name of the option chosen by the program):
Lose -> Sorry, but the computer chose <option>
Draw -> There is a draw (<option>)
Win -> Well done. The computer chose <option> and failed
For each draw, add 50 point to the score. For each user's win, add 100 to his/her score. In case the user loses, don't change the score.
If the input corresponds to anything else, output Invalid input
Play the game again
